It would be good idea to keep some personal knowledge base.

Such instance should be fairly easy to write, navigate.

It could consist of notes as well as hyperlinks to interesting articles,
tools.

One idea would be to use **zettelkasten** method, but for now I find it
mundane to search through date-based entries, with no particular
meaning.

Some requirements about similar method:

1. It should consist of personal notes, hyperlinks
1. Written in markdown or similar file-based format with portability in
mind
1. Be able to use different categories with own semantics (tools,
articles, notes, ideas).
1. Git versioning and remote (public?) access
1. Simple, foolproof tooling - more like a structured method than
   exquisite tools
1. Possibility to include public and private notes?
1. Continuous commits - similar to `pass`, etc. with commit every note 
   (you can rebase later)
