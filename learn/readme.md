## Pitfalls

I find myself often wandering into rabbit holes. E.g. spending 10h+ to
investigate the best way to organize links (bookmarks) and trying to
write a shell script for that.

This time may be efficient, yet it's generally a waste because, besides
brief learning of bash scripting, I don't provide any value to myself.

Any idea on overcoming **rabbit holes**? At the moment, not really. Just
stick to the plan and maybe investigate whether your plan is worth
pursuing in the firsthand.
