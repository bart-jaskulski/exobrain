# WordPress REST API always jsonifies response

Each time, you return something as `WP_REST_Response`, content of this 
response is passed through `json_encode` function. This way it's 
impossible to serve any other content, especially relying on raw 
string. Such value would be encoded from `"string"` to JSON form of 
`""string""`. As long as we use objects and arrays it's fine, but for 
scalar types (and content types other than JSON-based) we cannot rely on 
WP REST API directly.

To mitigate this, you can hook into `rest_pre_serve_request` and handle 
REST server response yourself.
